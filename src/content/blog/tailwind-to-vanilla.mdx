My first blog post, go me. Anyways...

### Journey

I have been coding for around a year now, and as time went on I gradually "upgraded" my
implementation of CSS by utilizing TailWind CSS. It seemed a natural progression as I hopped onto
the React bandwagon - utility classes that can be used in reusable components all based in
professional scales and systems.

I typed away in classNames with ease, inundating my html with "flex" and "justify between", throwing
together designs in short spurts of click clacking. Why did I need to design everything upfront when
it took such little effort to design?

Gliding along, I certainly made projects look presentable (probably), but a creeping suspicion
caught up with me: had I just been putting off my learning of CSS for ease and comfort?

It was around this time that I had been just getting the hang of Typescript and React, and I wanted
to learn more. What else could I learn? Instead of looking forward to something new on the
ever-expanding labyrinthine state of web development, perhaps it was best to look to the past, back
to the basics. I could easily write out some Javascipt, sure, but why did it work, and how?

I have read and am reading a couple of resources on JS itself. I wanted to take a deep dive, but
perhaps it was better to get a grasp of the lay of the land before plunging in.

[JavaScript for impatient programmers](https://exploringjs.com/) was an excellent book for this
purpose, and I learned many tidbits and core features that have oriented my JS coding with more
understanding and depth. Currently, I am taking notes on
[You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), which takes a more thorough look
into the pillars of JS. Although I have been a bit stymied in deciding whether to type out the notes
or write them out in my illegible cursive. That could be another topic I write about, take note of
it dear reader, pun intended.

Anyway, looking to master the fundamentals of web development, my gaze also fell upon the noble CSS.
I was become doubly interested since the hosts of [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) have been
extolling the recent upgrades CSS has received, such as container queries, :has(), and more. Brevity
is the soul of coding; decreasing the number of unnecessary dependencies while mastering CSS and not
being dependent on abstractions, now this would be useful for my development.

### Website

In this spirit, I decided to start this train of thought by converting my personal website's CSS
from tailwind to vanilla (no, not even SASS). This process truly exposed how lacking my CSS skills
were. One of the main qualms those beginning Tailwind have is the need to memorize all the utility
classes and what they map to. In a humorous reversal, I had trouble remembering what the original
properties were and what tailwind classes they mapped to. Thankfully, this process wasn't too hard
since my editor would explain the property on hover for each class.

As the html shone through and the style tags grew anew, I realized that it took roughly the same
amount of time writing using either methodology, since the editor's autocomplete finished off
everything.

Also, I did not have to worry much about the dreaded pitfall all coders run into sooner or later,
naming things, since [Astro](https://astro.build/), the framework I used, automatically encouraged
CSS modules, which made the shock less virulent.

Furthermore, I actually had a really fun time trying to condense CSS by using selectors,
pseduo-classes, and pseudo-elements. Imagine my face as I learned one can simply select which child
one wants to style rather than having to rewrite the whole CSS for each individual element, shook I
tell you.

Perhaps the point of greatest friction was trying to implement guiding design systems. I deliberated
back and forth, but in the end I just converted what Tailwind had and turned those into a set of CSS
variables, particularly for font sizing and colors. Using these variables with a great
[VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vunguyentuan.vscode-css-variables)
that automatically suggests them, it was a breeze utilizing system-wide standards.

And thus, with a bit more screwing up and fixing up, I had converted and even improved the design of
my website. I am proud of how it turned out.

### Conclusion

I relearned many things about CSS I had forgotten and learned many things too in the process of
redesigning my website. In the future I will try to stick with vanilla CSS and learn even more about
it. I had a fun time; now I can implement this into larger projects of mine.
