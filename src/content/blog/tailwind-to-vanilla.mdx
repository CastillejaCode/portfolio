So I guess this is my first blog post, go me. Anyways...

I have been getting into web development for the past year so far, and naturally I used CSS in my
projects.

But with each new project, I like to try yet another new technology on the web dev horizon.

I thus fell upon Tailwind and promptly began using it in all of my creations. This worked
particularly well as I made the shift towards frameworks and thus component-based UIs.

I had learned enough CSS to understand how to use Tailwind, which just replaces CSS values with
utility classes based on well-designed graphic systems.

Honestly, I didn't have a hard time learning it at all. The fast prototyping merged well with my
desire to learn and push out projects as fast as possible. But in hindsight, perhaps I was merely
just pushing away having to learn the full potential of CSS in favor of a fast and tested system,
focusing towards learning frameworks and typescript rather than let all the designing stuff "get in
the way".

I initally made this website in Tailwind, and I had a good time with it. But as I turned my
attention back towards the design sytem, I realized I needed to bring CSS back into my scope of
learning. Tailwind is an abstraction of CSS, inhrently befuddling some joys and pleasures of writing
CSS.

I have no problem writing Typescript, which is merely a superset of Javascript, it's lovely! But
Tailwind, while fast, did not lend learning core fundamentals to me.

I started to see some features I didn't really care. Working with grids was a pain, having to type
out the same styling for multiple components (no, I am not using @apply), not being able to use
selectors, I felt like I was missing out.

So why not just convert my website into Vanilla in order to learn?
