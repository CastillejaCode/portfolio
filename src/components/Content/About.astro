      <p>
        I am a self-taught web developer who likes to hike, bike, dance, read,
        and learn about everything (currently in my geology phase).
      </p>

      <p>
        I completed a BS in Psychobiology, became an EMT, and passed the MCAT
        with flying colors.
      </p>
      <p>I was going to become a doctor, but then I didn't.</p>
      <p>
        In college I made some amateur websites for my dance club and decided
        that route could be interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now I work everyday on learning as much as I can about the
        fascinating and complex world of web development.
