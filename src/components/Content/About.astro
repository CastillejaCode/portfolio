      <p>
        I am a self-taught web developer who likes to hike, bike, dance, read,
        and learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        I completed a BS in Psychobiology, became an EMT, and passed the MCAT
        with flying colors.
      </p>
      <p>I was going to become a doctor, initially.</p>
      <p>I decided not to become a doctor.</p>
      <p>
        In college I “made” websites for my dance club, and decided that would
        be a good as any other route.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since then, I have worked everyday on learning as much as I can
        about web development.
